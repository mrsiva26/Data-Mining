The size of the report is slightly higher (12 pages)  but most of it contains only output and not text. So I talked to Dr.Jason about it. He said since most of the report is the outputs asked in the HW5.pdf, it might not be a problem for the TA. Sorry about that.

1) How to run the code ?
Load the script onto RStudio by selecting File->open script->filename.
Click source.

2) What is it printing to console?
Prints true cluster sse ssb and generates graph for truecluster.
Then waits for user to input value of k.
Then prints k means cluster sse ssb and generates graph.

3)Where to find the input and output files
Output files will be generated in the working directory of R.
